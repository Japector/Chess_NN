# Chess Move Generation and AI Training with TensorFlow

This project contains the TensorFlow-based codebase for generating chess positions and training various types of neural network models to evaluate and play chess.

## â™Ÿ Position Generation
The project supports generation of various chess positions either randomly or using Stockfish:

### Available Options:
#### Mode:
- **random**   â€“ Generate positions randomly
- **mate**     â€“ Generate positions where one side can deliver checkmate
- **check**    â€“ Generate positions where the king is in check
- **draw**     â€“ Generate drawn positions

#### Generator:
- **random**    â€“ Use random move selection
- **stockfish** â€“ Use Stockfish engine to generate moves

#### Random Moves:
- Default: **50** random moves per generation run (customizable)

## ðŸ§  Model Training
Using the generated datasets, models can be trained with TensorFlow in three architectural variants:

### Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)
A simple dense layer model that treats board positions as flat vectors. Itâ€™s fast and efficient for learning general board evaluation but lacks spatial awareness.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Processes the board as a multi-channel spatial input (8x8x12). This allows the model to learn piece interactions and positional patterns more effectively.

### Q-Learning Model
A reinforcement learning approach where the model learns to evaluate moves based on long-term rewards. It enables the model to improve over time by learning through gameplay rather than supervised labels.

## ðŸŽ® Play Against AI
The project also includes a **Flask web interface** with an interactive chessboard.

- Moves are generated by the **trained models**, which are automatically loaded into a **dropdown list for both White and Black players**.
- The user can:
  - Play against any trained model
  - Watch models play against each other
  - Let models play against **Stockfish**
